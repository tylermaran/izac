put a location/date/time/whatever. append-only log. use
"git blame" or whatever to see who wrote the entry. that
should be easy huh?

Just got hit by a car on my way to nb. was on the
hood and everything lol. scuffed up the bottom of
my wrist a bit, which, will make tonight's coding
session a bit, uh, rough?

thankfully my longboard isn't busted considering it
just got fixed yesterday, but the turning on it is
a bit looser. I'll bring it into the shop with some
chocolate for the dude who fixed it up for me... I
think their name was Adrian?

but yeah, uh. folks during rush hour are wild & run
lights. I'll be more cautious from the line. the board
jumps now that adrian enabled "turbo mode" lmao.

bye.
